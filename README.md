### Next steps:

- The snake should speed up as it eats more pellets
- The snake speed should be dependent on the game board size. A larger grid should start the game with a faster snake
- The game should have touch/click event listeners to work on mobile. This can be done by dividing the screen into 4 pieces with something that looks like an X. The top section of the X would move the snake up.
- An indicator should count the amount of pellets the snake has eaten.
- Three-dimensional snake
- A multiplayer version can be made where the players can try to block the other snake. Something similar to TRON Classic comes to mind.
